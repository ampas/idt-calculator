## Package Contents

* [`aces/`](./aces) - *Python* package containing the API code.
* [`apps/`](./apps) - *Python* package of the online Apps.
* [`assets/`](./assets) - Assets, e.g. CSS files for the online Apps.
* [`docs/`](./docs) - Documentation for the API code.

## Prerequisites

### Docker (Users)

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is the only requirement to run the Apps locally. 

#### Python & Poetry (Developers)

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) is recommended for developers willing to contribute to the project.
The [`pyproject.toml`](./pyproject.toml) file defines the various packages required.
It is also possible to use the [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt) file to generate a virtual environment with all the dependencies.

## Installation

### Docker (Users)

```bash
$ docker build --platform=linux/amd64 \
-t ampas/ampas-apps:latest \
-t ampas/ampas-apps:latest-amd64 .
```

The apps can then be launched locally as follows:

```bash
$ docker run -d \ 
--name=ampas-apps
-p 8010:8000 ampas/ampas-apps:latest-amd64
```

#### Python & Poetry (Developers)

```bash
$ poetry install
```

The Apps can then be launched locally as follows:

```bash
$ poetry run python index.py
```

or

```bash
$ poetry run invoke docker-run
```

## Usage

Each App has an `About` tab describing the given App and its usage.

### Prosumer Camera IDT Archive

The IDT App for Prosumer Cameras requires a Zip archive file, i.e. IDT archive, with a specific structure and content.

### Explicit Specification

The explicit specification of the IDT archive requires a root JSON file describing the paths to the various image sequences.

![IDT Archive Explicit Structure](docs/_static/idt_archive_explicit_structure.png)

The root JSON file describes which image sequences correspond to which exposure value, flatfield and grey card.

![IDT Archive Explicit JSON File](docs/_static/idt_archive_explicit_json_file.png)

The JSON schema for the IDT archive can be used to validate a new user file using a [validator](http://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/) and is defined as follows:

```json
{
    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "header": {

### Implicit Specification

The implicit specification of the IDT archive requires that the image sequences are stored in specific directories that match the JSON schema:

![IDT Archive Implicit Structure](docs/_static/idt_archive_implicit_structure.png)

The implicit specification cannot represent some of the metadata that the explicit specification supports, e.g. `manufacture` or `exposure_settings`.
